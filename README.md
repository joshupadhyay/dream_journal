## Complatability

All android and iOS mobile devices (not iPads, tablets, or desktop).

## Required Software

To run the app using Flutter, you will need the following software:
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
* [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)

## Setup (using an Android Emulator)

1. Open Android Studio and create a new Flutter Project

2. On the top bar, click VCS >>> Checkout from Version Control >>> Git

3. Copy paste in the following link: https://github.com/joshupadhyay/dream_journal.git

4. If it doesn't say 'main.dart' and instead says 'Edit Configurations...', set it to 'main.dart'

5. Click the Phone with Android icon to configure your Virtual Device.

6. Pick an emulator (Nexus 6 recommended) and the Pie system image.

7. Run the app on your emulator! If you get an error the first few times, hit the 'get dependencies'
until it works.
